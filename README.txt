During my time at the Arewa Ladies for Tech Bootcamp, I worked on several impactful data analysis projects that honed my skills and built my confidence in various tools such as Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Python.

One of my key projects involved the Bike sales,analyzing large datasets to uncover trends and insights that informed strategic decisions. Using Excel, I performed data cleaning, manipulation, and advanced statistical analyses to ensure the data's accuracy and relevance.

In the Superstore project, I utilized Power BI to create dynamic and interactive dashboard. The visualization provided clear and actionable insights to stakeholders, helping them understand complex data through intuitive graphics and drill-down capabilities.

My SQL skills were put to the test when I was tasked with querying Suicide in India dataset. I wrote complex queries to extract, join, and aggregate data from multiple tables, ensuring the results were accurate and efficient. This experience strengthened my understanding of database structures and optimization techniques.

Python was instrumental in automating data analysis tasks and performing more advanced analytics. I wrote scripts using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to preprocess data, conduct statistical analyses, and web scraping. This automation saved significant time and provided deeper insights that manual methods couldn't achieve.

These projects have significantly boosted my confidence in using these tools and have prepared me to tackle complex data analysis challenges in future roles. 

The hands-on experience and practical application of these skills at the Arewa Ladies for Tech Bootcamp have been invaluable in my journey towards becoming a proficient data analyst in the Health Tech and drug discovery sectors.
